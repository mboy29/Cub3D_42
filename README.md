# Cub3D_42

To find all the information (including a French-translated version of Lode's Computer Graphics Tutorial) you need to know before starting the project, git clone this repertory and open Docub3D.pdf. Take into account that the project has been programmed for MacOS and won't work on Linux for example (you will have to adapt the MiniLibX and the Makefile in order for it to work).

Execute Normal Project : make && ./cub3D Maps/map.cub
